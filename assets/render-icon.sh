# Regenerates assets/icon-1024.png from assets/Headroom.icon.
#
# `Headroom.icon` is the source of truth, but it can only be *rendered* by actool, which lives inside
# Xcode.app. `build.sh` must work with the Command Line Tools alone, so the render is committed as a
# flat PNG and build.sh downscales that into the .icns. This script is what keeps the two in step —
# run it whenever the Icon Composer document changes, and commit the result alongside it.
#
# Requires Xcode. That is not a new burden: Icon Composer, the only thing that edits the document in
# the first place, ships with Xcode too.
#
# Why actool rather than Icon Composer's own File ▸ Export: actool renders the icon the way macOS 26
# actually composites it — the material treatment, the drop shadow, and Apple's 824-of-1024 grid —
# whereas the Icon Composer export is full-bleed, because on macOS 26 the system supplies the mask
# and shadow itself. A full-bleed source has to be inset again before it can become a .icns, and
# getting that inset wrong is invisible until the icon is a quarter too large next to other apps on
# macOS 13-15. Taking actool's already-on-grid render removes that whole step.
