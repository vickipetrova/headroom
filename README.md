# Headroom

Your Claude Code plan usage, in the macOS menu bar:

```
✻ 42% · 67%
```

Session (5-hour window) on the left, this week on the right. Click for reset times, live
countdowns, and per-model weekly limits when your plan reports them.

<!-- HERO GIF: record the menu bar with the dropdown open, save it as assets/headroom.gif,
     and uncomment the line below.

**Zero setup.** No cookies, no DevTools, nothing to paste. Headroom reads the OAuth token Claude
Code already has and asks Anthropic the same question `/usage` does.

## How it works

Every five minutes (configurable), Headroom sends one request:

```
GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage
Authorization: Bearer <your Claude Code token>
anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20
```

The token comes from wherever Claude Code keeps it — the macOS login Keychain (generic password,
service `Claude Code-credentials`) or `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. If both exist, Headroom uses
whichever one lives longest, so a leftover file can't shadow your live login.

Claude Code refreshes that token itself while you work, so there is nothing to maintain. If it has
gone stale because you haven't opened Claude Code in a while, the menu says so.

The first Keychain read prompts for permission, because Claude Code's Keychain item only trusts the
app that created it. Note that "Always Allow" won't stick across a rebuild if you built from source —
ad-hoc signatures change every time, so macOS sees a different app.

Because this is account-level data rather than session lifecycle, it keeps working when Claude Code
is closed.

## Install

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vickipetrova/headroom.git
cd headroom
./build.sh
cp -R build/Headroom.app /Applications/
open /Applications/Headroom.app
```

That's the whole toolchain: the Xcode Command Line Tools. No Xcode project, no third-party
dependencies. Tests run with `swift test --disable-xctest` — plain `swift test` needs XCTest, which
the Command Line Tools don't ship.

`swift run` won't work, and that's expected — it produces a bare binary with no `Info.plist`, so
there's no `LSUIElement`, no bundle identity for login items, and no notification registration.
`./build.sh && open build/Headroom.app` is the way to run it.

### DMG

Download the latest `Headroom.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases), open it, and drag Headroom into
Applications.

## Requirements

- **macOS 13+** (Ventura). Launch at login uses `SMAppService`, which is 13.0 and later.
- **A Claude Pro or Max plan.** Session and weekly windows are plan quotas. Metered API-key
  accounts don't have them, so there is nothing for Headroom to show — it says so plainly instead
  of showing zeroes.
- **Claude Code, signed in at least once**, so there's a token to read. If you set
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, Headroom won't find your login — Claude Code moves both the credentials file
  and the Keychain service name to match, and an app launched from Finder can't see that variable.

## Settings

Everything lives in the dropdown under **Settings**:

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Refresh every | 1 / 5 / 15 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Notify above | Off / 50% / 80% / 90% | 80% |
| Show in Menu Bar | any combination of the limits your plan reports | Session + Weekly |
| Colors | Alerts only / System | Alerts only |
| Launch at Login | on / off | off |

**Show in Menu Bar** picks which numbers appear in the title. The list is built from whatever the
API currently reports, so a per-model limit shows up by name once your plan has one. Choices are
stored against each limit's identifier rather than its name, so a limit that disappears for a while
comes back selected rather than silently reset — and at least one always stays on.

**Colors** decides how much the menu bar and the panel use colour. *Alerts only* keeps the spark
orange and everything else in the ordinary label colour until usage is worth noticing, then turns
yellow at 50% and red at 80% — so colour means "look at this" rather than being permanently on.
*System* is fully monochrome: the thresholds stop applying entirely and the spark becomes a template
image, so the whole item adapts like a built-in menu bar control.

Alerts fire at most once per window per reset period, so sitting at 85% doesn't produce an alert on
every poll. Lowering the threshold mid-window counts as a new crossing and will alert again.

macOS asks for notification permission the first time Headroom runs with alerts switched on. If you
decline — or later switch Headroom off in System Settings › Notifications — the menu says
*"Alerts blocked — open Notification settings"* rather than silently never alerting you.

## Roadmap

Deliberately small for v0.1. Not planned by me, but very welcome as contributions — these are
filed as [good first issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22):

- Multiple accounts in one menu
- A historical sparkline of the session window
- Reading usage from Claude Code's statusline stdin instead of polling
- A configurable menu bar title format
- A model-scoped-only mode (show just the Opus/Fable weekly line)
- Graceful mode for non-Pro/Max accounts
- Additional providers — Cursor, Codex, Copilot — behind the existing `UsageProvider` protocol

Out of scope: cost dashboards, telemetry, anything needing an API key. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Other projects in this space

There are several good ones, and they solve different problems. If Headroom isn't the shape you
want, one of these probably is:

- **[ClaudeBar](https://github.com/tddworks/ClaudeBar)** — the big one. Tracks a dozen assistants
  (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, and more), themes, Homebrew cask.
- **[Claude Usage Bar](https://github.com/Blimp-Labs/claude-usage-bar)** — richer detail: usage
  history charts, per-model breakdown, extra-usage spend in USD.
- **[ClaudeUsageBar](https://github.com/Artzainnn/claudeusagebar)** — covers claude.ai usage too,
  not just Claude Code. Setup is copying a cookie out of DevTools.
- **[Claude Usage](https://github.com/richhickson/claudecodeusage)** — closest to Headroom in
  spirit: small, native, session and weekly at a glance.
- **[Claude Status Bar](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar)** — a different question
  entirely: whether Claude Code is *currently* thinking, running a tool, or waiting on you. Pairs
  well with this one, and its repo is the template this one's build script follows.

Headroom's one distinguishing bet is that you shouldn't have to set anything up.

## Uninstall

```bash
rm -rf /Applications/Headroom.app
defaults delete com.vickipetrova.headroom
```

If you turned on Launch at Login, switch it off first (or remove Headroom from System Settings ›
General › Login Items). Headroom writes nothing else — no caches, no logs, no config files.

## Security

Headroom reads your OAuth token, holds it in memory for one request, and sends it to exactly one
place: `api.anthropic.com`. No telemetry, no analytics, no update checks. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
