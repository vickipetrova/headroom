#
# Two tiers, and the boundary between them is deliberately *additive*: the .icns is always the one
# built here from the flattened export, byte for byte, whether or not Xcode is installed. Xcode only
# ever adds the layered icon on top. A contributor with the Command Line Tools alone and CI therefore

# only downscaled here. Do not add an inset step: it is already inset, and doing it twice makes the
# icon visibly small. Re-run render-icon.sh, don't compensate in this file.
#

# Ad-hoc by default. Set HEADROOM_SIGN_ID to a signing identity in your Keychain to use that
# instead — no secret ever lives in this repo, and this script still knows nothing about
# notarization, which stays a manual maintainer step (docs/RELEASING.md).
#
# Worth doing while developing: an ad-hoc signature's designated requirement is the binary's own
# hash, so every code change makes Headroom a different app to macOS and the Keychain re-asks for
# permission to read your Claude Code login. A real identity gives a stable, identity-based
# requirement, so "Always Allow" sticks across rebuilds:
#
#   HEADROOM_SIGN_ID="Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)" ./build.sh
#
# xattr first: extended attributes (quarantine, Finder info) make codesign refuse the bundle, and
# that is the one benign failure this step used to swallow.
#
# Nothing else may be swallowed. Apple Silicon refuses to launch a binary carrying no signature at
# all, so hiding a codesign failure here does not produce an unsigned-but-working app — it produces
# a build that dies at launch as "Headroom is damaged", with the actual error discarded.
